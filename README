== Front Door

Front Door is a dead simple RESTful authentication service. I wrote this because I didn't really need all of the features of a CAS or a more complex authentication system. I just needed a way to perform basic CRUD actions on a User model, and a way to persist a user's session.

* To install:
1) Pull down the code
2) Run bundle install
3) Run rake db:migrate
4) Start the server

Settings:
  Token::SESSION_TIME = 30 (30 minutes by default. You can change to your liking)

* To use

To create a new user:
  resp = post 'users.json', :username => 'dannyboy', :password => "pass", :password_confirmation => "pass"
  resp.body 
 => "{\"application_id\":null,\"created_at\":\"2011-06-13T21:12:22Z\",\"id\":6,\"last_login_at\":null,\"logins\":0,\"updated_at\":\"2011-06-13T21:12:22Z\",\"username\":\"dannyboy\",\"host\":\"localhost:3001\",\"protocol\":\"http://\",\"_path_segments\":{\"action\":\"create\",\"controller\":\"users\",\"format\":\"json\"},\"script_name\":\"\"}"
  
To authenticate that user:
  resp = post 'login.json', :username => 'dannyboy', :password => "pass"
  resp.body
  => "{\"token\":\"dd2e2550-7830-012e-5c8f-001ec2baced6\"}"

To check if that user is currently logged in (token was created within the session time):
resp = post 'logged_in.json', :token => 'dd2e2550-7830-012e-5c8f-001ec2baced6'
resp.body
=> "{\"logged_in\":true}"

You can now pass that token along to "/users" with PUT or GET for update and show actions.

Todo:
  - Migrate to NoSQL for scalability and speed benefits
  - Migrate to Sinatra app to make more lightweight
